Exercises with variables (revision - we've done most of this before!

This script contains 3 exercises, ecah one is contiained in a separate function. If you run the script, all three functions will be called (you can see this at the bottom of the script)
However at the moment they dont' print anythign at all, so it will look like nothig has happened. Your job is to go through each of the three functions and do what it says in the
instruction comments, so that each will print an answer. You can run the scriopt as many times as you like to check if your code is working.

when you have finishes, you might like to try adding a fourth function, by writing "def exercise_204()", and making it do whatever you like.

Good luck!
